concat():-

The Java String concat() method concatenates one string to the end of another string. This method returns a string with the value of the string passed into the method, appended to the end of the string. Consider the below illustration
ex:- syntex
public String concat(String anostr)  

String+=:-

Since String is immutable in java, when you do a +, += or concat(String), a new String is generated. The bigger the String gets the longer it takes - there is more to copy and more garbage is produced.
Today's java compilers optimizes your string concatenation to make it optimal, e.g.
System.out.println("x:"+x+" y:"+y);
